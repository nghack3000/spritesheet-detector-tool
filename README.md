SpriteSheet Frame Detector & JSON Exporter

This is a powerful, single-file web application designed for game developers. It allows you to upload a spritesheet (or an animated GIF), automatically detect or manually select individual frames, and export the corresponding JSON data required by game engines like Phaser.
Features

    Auto-Detection: Automatically finds all individual sprites on a transparent background.

    Manual Selection: Manually click and select frames in a specific order to create custom animation sequences.

    GIF to Spritesheet: Upload an animated GIF, and the tool will instantly convert it into a usable spritesheet strip.

    JSON Export: Generates framework-agnostic JSON data that describes the position and size of each frame.

    Custom Spritesheet Export: In manual mode, you can download a new, clean PNG spritesheet containing only your selected frames.

    Frame Order Control: Sort frames to match your spritesheet layout, ensuring correct animation sequences.
